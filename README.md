My checkers game, here are the rules:
1. The player who opens the room will play first
2. You can only eat forward, unless you ate and have an option to eat again, in that case you may eat in any direction
3. The burnt rule applies, if you make a move that wasnt an eat move, and had an option to eat, that checker will burn and be marked for the next turn
4. Queens can move and eat in any direction, movement is the same as a pawn just for any direction
5. After a player eats, he may choose to skip his turn without eating again if he has the option

Still requires more updates as not all sockets work properlly yet
