# checkers-app
My checkers game, here are the rules:
1. The player who clicks start game first will begin as the white player
2. You can only eat forward, unless you ate and have an option to eat again, in that case you may eat in any direction
3. The burnt rule applies, if you make a move that wasnt an eat move, and had an option to eat, that checker will burn and be marked for the next turn
4. Queens can move and eat in any direction, movement is the same as a pawn just for any direction
5. After a player eats, he may choose to skip his turn without eating again if he has the option

The game includes a dynamic rating system, each user gets 3 ratings for a win, 1 for a loss, and in case the users have a high rating difference, the lower rating user will gain double the ratings, and the other using will gain only half.
Enjoy!
